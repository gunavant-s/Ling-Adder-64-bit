In Verilog, signals can be continuously assigned values using assign statements without the need for procedural blocks like always or initial. 
Continuous assignments are evaluated whenever any of the input signals change.
So instead of always block, assign statements are used.
Using initial begin for continuous assignments is not recommended in Verilog. 
The initial block is typically used for initializing variables or executing certain procedural statements at the beginning of simulation, not for continuous assignments.
We can modify using "always @(posedge clk) begin ______ end ".
